== Pinger

This is a barebones Ruby on Rails application that can be used to ping a list of destinations on the Internet. A cron job to repeatedly run the `ping_all` rake task, which kicks off the process. In the future, much of the HTTP requests can actually be backgrounded through Resque or Sidekiq.
